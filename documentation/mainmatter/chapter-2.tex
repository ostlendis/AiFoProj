In order to make use of ChatGPT in your application so called "assistants" can be used by calling the OpenAI-API.
We created our assistant under the name ``fabio\_silvan\_giftassistant'' and provided it with system instructions.
It was instructed to provide 5 gift ideas and to parse the input as constraints accordingly.
As a model we chose ``gpt-4o-mini'' as it is compatible with json\_schema-formats (see \ref{fig:jsonschema}) and more than capable for our task.
The json-schema helps control the output format which in turn makes parsing the returned message in our application a lot easier.
