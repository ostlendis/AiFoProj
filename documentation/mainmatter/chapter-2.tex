To integrate ChatGPT into our application, we utilized the OpenAI API to set up a specialized "assistant" named ``fabio\_silvan\_giftassistant''.
This assistant is specifically to generate gift ideas based on user-provided preferences and constraints that come from the Frontend.
By configuring system instructions tailored to our requirements, we ensured that it would effectively parse input constraints and consistently return a list of five gift suggestions.

For the model, we selected gpt-4-turbo due to its compatibility with JSON Schema formats, which enables structured outputs and ensures an easy integration with our application's data parsing processes.
Using JSON Schema has proven especially helpful in guiding the assistant\textquotesingle s response structure, making the parsing of returned messages easier.

While additional tools like file search, code interpreter, and external function calling are available, we found them unnecessary for this project.
The assistant\textquotesingle s core design and clear output schema provide all the functionality needed to meet our specific gift recommendation requirements.
